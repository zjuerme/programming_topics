# programming_topics
 project for 2022 Spring/Summer Semester Zhejiang University Curriculum Programming topic

This project must use the graphics package provided by the school, rather than **QT** or **python**, which is commonly used at present. Moreover, the graphics package has a lot of bugs, such as not supporting Chinese strings when it is clearly a Chinese project, unsolvable bugs in normal functions, etc. It was a chore to write, and it didn't really help my abilities, because I was actually just writing code in a dropped library

Hopefully this course will improve in the future
